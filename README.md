## 🚀 Figma to Flutter UI Challenge - 2 🎨➡️📱

As a Flutter learner, I picked a random UI design from Dribbble and challenged myself to bring it to life in Flutter! 🛠️ This helped me practice UI development and level up my Flutter skills.</br>

💡 What I Learned:</br>
✅ Breaking down UI into reusable Flutter widgets</br>
✅ Managing layout and responsiveness effectively</br>
✅ Choosing the right Flutter components</br>
✅ Working with Cards and MediaQuery for a better adaptive design</br>
